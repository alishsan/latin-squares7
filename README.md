# Latin Squares 7: A Mathematical Game

A strategic two-player game played on a 7×7 board where Alice and Bob alternate placing numbers 1–7, ensuring no repeats in any row or column. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. This project explores **who can guarantee a win** (Alice or Bob) with perfect play, using Clojure and AI-driven analysis.

## Key Features
- **Game Engine**: Pure functional implementation in Clojure.
- **AI Opponent**: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) enhanced with neural networks (Cortex).
- **Mathematical Focus**: Solves the combinatorial problem of guaranteed wins.
